Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey — a space where I document the projects, lessons, and experiments I've explored as I deepen my understanding of data-driven systems.

My focus lies in:
- Building intelligent systems using neural networks and deep learning.
- Solving real-world problems with predictive models.
- Bridging theory and practice through hands-on experimentation.

## 🔍 Highlights
- 📈 Applied time series models for financial data forecasting.
- 📝 Conducted sentiment analysis using NLP and TF-IDF/Embeddings.
